# Angular Admin Panel with Taiga-UI and Bulma.css

This Admin Panel is created for Angular project with Taiga-UI and Bulma CSS. I already removed so many Bulma CSS class which is clashes with the class from Taiga-UI like .input class, so there are no CSS class bug with this Admin Panel and you can use Bulma class freely without any issue.
